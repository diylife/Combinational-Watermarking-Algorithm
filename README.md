# Combinational-Watermarking-Algorithm
Combinational Spatial and Frequency Domains Watermarking for 2D Vector Map
Our experimental result had been implemented with windows 10 professional and Matlab 9.4.0 and the real data from local surveying and mapping department with different shape files. The code of the algorithms for embedding and extracting watermarks and the data of the four experiments are attached as a zip file. The code for watermark embedding is in the SpaceFFTEmbed.m file and the watermark extracting is in the SpaceFFTExtract.m file, the code file logisticE.m is used for shuffling watermark before embedding, file logisticE.m is used for Anti-shuffling after watermark extracted, code file NC.m is the implementation for calculating NC, and the four folders such as Data-a contain the test data used in the experiments.
